# Package-Retrieval_Robot

This project was done in the METE 3100U - Mechatronics Design course at Ontario Tech University. The goal of the project was to design and program a robot that navigates a test area to pick up LEGO blocks and drop them off at another location in the test area. 

The project was divided into 3 phases, A, B, and C, with each phase building on the previous one. 

Phase A - Autonomous Navigation
In this phase, the goal of the robot is to travel a minimum 2m distance and execute 5 turns. The robot's coordinates must be displayed and it must return to the starting location...
